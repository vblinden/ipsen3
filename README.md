# LeenMeij Web Application

## About
The fictional LeenMeij vehicle rental company wants a web applicaton running besides it's already existing desktop application to lure more customers to the company. This project is for a course from the Hogeschool Leiden in the Netherlands. The web application is made with the Laravel PHP Framework (http://www.laravel.com)

## Contributing
You can use your own choice of development server (XAMPP, MAMP, etc), but if you want to use the PHP's internal development server (PHP 5.4+ required) you can open up a console and run 

```
php artisan serve
```

in the root directory of the application to start the development server.
